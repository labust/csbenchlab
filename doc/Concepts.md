# Environment

The central concept for evaluating the quality of controllers for dynamical system control is called an Environment.
The Environment is manifested as a ".slx" simulink scheme that is autogenerated and constructed by a "config.json"
file as a recipe.

The Environment is composed from four integral parts:

1) System
    - Defined as a Matlab Class (that inherits from DynSystem) or a Simulink block to be used as a System block
    - The system block is replicated N times, where N is the number of controllers in the Environment
    - The Environment ensures that each controller has its own, correctly configured System instance
    - Changes to the System instances are not permited (and not possible) in the Environment.
    - Modification of the System definition is recommended by using GUI or user functions
        - create_environment
        - update_environment
        - clear_environment
        - regenerate_environment

2) Controllers
    - Defined as a list of Matlab objects of type [ControllerOptions](./MatlabModel.md#controlleroptions)
    - A Controller is realized as a Matlab Class (that inherits from Controller) or a Simulink block to be used as a Controller block
    - A Controller can be composed of multiple subcontrollers, each controlling a subset of the system DOFs
    - Each controller is configured separately
    - Modification of the Controller definition is recommended by using GUI or user functions
        - add_controller
        - remove_controller


3) Scenario definition file
    - Realized as a list of Scenario structures or the path to the ".mat" file containing Scenario structures
    - A Scenario represents one simulation instance for the Environment
    - A Scenario defines a TODO: (Link) Reference, system parameters and the system initial condition
    - TODO: (Link) load_references, edit_references, load_scenarios, save_scenarios

4) Plots
    - Realized as a list of Plot structures or the path to the ".mat" file containing Plot structures
    - A Plot defines options for plotting the result data after the simulation is successful
    - TODO: (Link) load_plots, save_plots



# Controller

A Controller refers to a control algorithm implemented as a Matlab Class or a Simulink block.
The goal of the Controller is to govern the behavior of a dynamical system by processing its measurements
and generating appropriate control signals. To be able to use various Controllers in the Environment,
all Controllers should have the predefined generic form. A guide for custom Controller implementation is
shown bellow. Implementation details can be found in [Controllers](doc/Controllers.md).

The Controller can be added to the Environment by using the TODO: link add_controller function. The controller
definition can be found at TODO: link ControllerOptions



# Scenario

A Scenario defines the specific conditions under which the System operates within an Environment.
For example, a Scenario might specify different initial conditions, system parameters,
or external disturbances to reflect various real-world operating conditions.
This allows for comprehensive testing of how controllers respond to a wide range of scenarios.

Scenario definition can be found in TODO: Link
